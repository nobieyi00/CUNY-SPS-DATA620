This week's assignment is to:
1. Load a graph database of your choosing from a text file or other source. If you take a
large network dataset from the web (such as from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/), please
feel free at this point to load just a small subset of the nodes and edges.
2. Create basic analysis on the graph, including the graphâ€™s diameter, and at least one other
metric of your choosing. You may either code the functions by hand (to build your
intuition and insight), or use functions in an existing package.
3. Use a visualization tool of your choice (Neo4j, Gephi, etc.) to display information.
4. Please record a short video (~ 5 minutes), and submit a link to the video as part of your
homework submission.
You may work in a small group on this project. Parts one and two should be posted to GitHub
and submitted in your assignment link by end of day September 12th. Parts 3 and 4 should
be in your video presentation. We may display some of the results in our Meet-up on
September 13th
